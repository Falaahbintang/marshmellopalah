        Christopher Comstock (born May 19, 1992), known professionally as
        Marshmello, is an American electronic music producer and DJ.<br />
        His songs "Silence", "Wolves", "Friends", "Happier", and "Alone" have
        been certified multi-platinum in several countries and appeared in<br />
        the Top 30 of the Billboard Hot 100. His musical style includes
        groove-oriented, synth and bass-heavy electronic dance music.<br />
        He is managed by Moe Shalizi.

        <br />
        Marshmello first gained international recognition in early 2015 by
        publishing remixes online.<br />
        His debut studio album, Joytime, was released in January 2016, which
        included the lead single and Marshmello's debut single<br />
        "Keep It Mello". "Alone", a platinum-certified single was released in
        May 2016 via the Canadian record label Monstercat.<br />
        Having peaked on the US Billboard Hot 100 at number 60, it became his
        first single to be certified platinum in the US and <br />
        Canada with over 1 million copies of certified units. That year, he
        released three subsequent singles. In 2017, after releasing singles<br />
        such as "Chasing Colors", "Twinbow" and "Moving On", Marshmello
        collaborated with American R&B singer Khalid to release "Silence" <br />
        as a single, which was certified platinum and multi-platinum in eight
        countries. Succeeding another single, <br />
        one of his estselling singles, a collaboration with American singer
        Selena Gomez, titled "Wolves" was released.

        children. With the single "Happier"<br />
        and its pet-dog-themed video, he supported the #FindYourFido campaign by
